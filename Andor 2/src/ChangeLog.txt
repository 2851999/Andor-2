This is the first commit after starting a partial rewrite of
Andor. At this time, it has less features than Andor, but
some tests show that this new version almost doubles
the performance. There may be a while between commits as I
will be trying to get this new version to the same level as
Andor reached, but I intend to add some major new features
that will take some time to implement such as adding collada
support with skeletal animations which I have never even
attempted to do before. Therefore it will be a while before
there will be any major release of Andor 2 but by this time,
the feature set should exceed that of the original.
