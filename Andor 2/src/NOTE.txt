Andor 2 is the successor to Andor which began to suffer memory issues through several
flaws in its design. This is why a lot of the engine will now be rewritten in order to
correct these issues and create a platform in which to try out better things. This
move will likely see several major changes, as the new version will be written with
performance in mind unlike Andor which was written mainly for ease of use. One such
major change is the removal of Android support this is for the foreseable future,
however it may be added again once the engine is fully functional.
